Command used to extract subset of Boost:
	Version 1.59 seems to work as long as 'config' is included in the build list (shown below).
	In boost dir:
	./bootstrap.sh
	./b2 tools/bcp
	./dist/bin/bcp build config $DEPS <out_dir>
	
Command used to build extraced subset of Boost:
	cd <out_dir>
	./boostrap.sh --prefix=<install_dir>
	./b2 install

Troubleshooting:
	If building bcp failed, it may be because you built boost under sudo (e.g., sudo ./b2 install). Thus, just use sudo if necessary to build it, or clean boost an rebuild without sudo.
